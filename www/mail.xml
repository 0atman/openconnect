    	<h1>Mailing lists</h1>

	<p>There is a mailing list at <tt><a href="mailto:openconnect-devel@lists.infradead.org">
	openconnect-devel@lists.infradead.org</a></tt>.</p>

	<p>Please read the recent messages in the <a
	href="http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openconnect-devel/">archive</a> before
	posting a question that is likely to have been asked before.</p>

	<p>You do <em>not</em> have to be subscribed to the list in order to post a question. If you have
	questions or problems, <em>PLEASE</em> post them to the mailing list rather than putting
	them on some random web forum where they are unlikely to get a quick or knowledgeable response.</p>

	<p>If you do want to subscribe to the mailing list, you can do so from the <a
	href="http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/openconnect-devel">Mailman admin page</a>.</p>

	<p>Please note that the mailing list, like many technical mailing lists, does not accept
	HTML messages. You should post as plain text only. Other tips on 'netiquette' can be found
	on <a href="http://david.woodhou.se/email.html">this page</a>.</p>



	Before posting to the list, read this:
	<p>
	  <b>SECURITY WARNING:</b><br/>
	  If you are posting debugging output from openconnect to the mailing list, do <em>not</em> include a line which looks like this:
	  <br/><tt>Set-Cookie: webvpn=835278264@921600@1221512527@6B9EC24DEB2F59E242F75B424D42F223D0912984;PATH=/</tt><br/>
	  That HTTP cookie is all that's needed to grant access to the VPN session you just logged in to &#8212;
	  it's almost as bad as giving your password away. Version 2.26 or later of OpenConnect will 
	  automatically filter this out of the debugging output for you.
