    	<h1>Getting Started</h1>

	<p>As root, run the following command:<br/>
      <tt>openconnect --script /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script https://vpn.mycompany.com/</tt>
    </p>

That should be it, if you have a password-based login. If you use
certificates, you'll need to tell OpenConnect where to find the
certificate with the <tt>-c</tt> option. You might need to steal the
certificate from your Windows certificate store using a tool like <a

<p>
You can ignore anything you see in the compatibility page about needing to patch OpenSSL
so that DTLS works &#8212; you don't really need it, although it will
make your connections much faster if you're experiencing packet loss
between you and the VPN server. But you can worry about that later.
