<h1>Install a <tt>vpnc-script</tt>.</h1>

<p>This script is what sets up all the addresses and routes for you; it's the
same as <tt>vpnc</tt>'s, and if you have the <tt>vpnc</tt> package installed
then you may already have a <tt>vpnc-script</tt> installed with it, perhaps in
a directory like <tt>/etc/vpnc/vpnc-script</tt>.</p>

<p>If you don't already have it, you can get a current version from <a
href="http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/vpnc-scripts.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/vpnc-script">here</a>.
Even if you already have a copy from vpnc, you may wish to install this updated
version which has support for IPv6, and for running on Solaris and on newer Linux
kernels amongst other bug fixes.</p>

<p>Note that the script needs to be executable, and stored somewhere
where SELinux or similar security systems won't prevent the root user
from accessing it.</p>
