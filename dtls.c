 * The master-secret is generated randomly by the client. The server
 * responds with a DTLS Session-ID. These, done over the HTTPS
 * connection, are enough to 'resume' a DTLS session, bypassing all
 * the normal setup of a normal DTLS connection.
 * 
 * Cisco's own client uses an old version of OpenSSL, which implements
 * the pre-RFC version of DTLS. I haven't been able to get it working 
 * when I force it to link against any of my own builds of OpenSSL.
 *
 * Hopefully, it'll just work when I get round to implementing it
 * here, either with the system OpenSSL, or linking against their
 * library (which will at least be progress, and make it a little
 * easier to debug.
